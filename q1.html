        <h2> form action: http://localhost:3002/send/ </h2>
        <p>
            Within this action, the link provided is not an absolute link with the ".com" at the end since it starts as a "http" address. The /send should not be there either.
        </p>

            <h2> form action: https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/ </h2>

        <p> 
            This action is almost correct, but shares the same error as the previous action since it has a /send at the end of the address which will not load on github pages.
