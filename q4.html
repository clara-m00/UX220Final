            <h2> Ways that .png is superior to .jpg </h2>
            <p> 
                <ul>
                    <li> .pngs do not lose their quality from compression and don't become bluury or distorted no matter what you do </li>
                    <li> .pngs support transparency, so you can have different background for your image, text or logo
                    <li> due to the fact that quality is not compromised, .pngs have sharper and crisper quality which is especially good for web graphics and logos
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2> Ways .png is inferior to .jpg </h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> .jpgs are smaller in file size, which might be more favourable
                    <li> .jpgs are great for photographs as they support CMYK printing whereas .pngs are more for web usage
                </ul>
